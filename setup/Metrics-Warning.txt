This application will upload metric data to a remote server in order to help find and diagnose issues.

If you wish to opt out of collection of this data, do the following:
Create an extensionless file named METRICS_OPT_OUT in %APPDATA%\VnManager

If you do not create the METRICS_OPT_OUT file, you agree to the collection of metrics and error data.

If you have any questions/concerns, please open an issue at https://github.com/micah686/VnManager/issues
