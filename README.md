# VnManager
A program to keep track of your visual novels

### Please note that all work on v2 of the program has ceased (Visual-Novel-Manager-v2) 

The application is being completely redesinged, all of that work is going on in the v3 branch. 
This master branch will not be updated until the v3 version is at least in a usable state.
